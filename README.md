#Mini Javascript Projects

The projects in this repository are created by me in order to study and get familiar with vanilla Javascript, as well as basic HTML and CSS at their most fundamental level.

Most of the projects here are inspired by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop's Udemy Course: "50 Projects In 50 Days".
